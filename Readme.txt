Trump’s Twitter Analysis
Introduction: As a political figure, Donald J. Trump used Twitter to praise, to cajole, to entertain, 
to lobby, to establish his version of events and, perhaps most notably, to amplify his scorn. This list 
documents the verbal attacks Mr. Trump posted on Twitter, from when he declared his candidacy in June 2015 to Jan. 8, 
when twitter permanently banned him.

Problem Statement: The objective of this project is to build an algorithm that can accurately classify Twitter messages
as positive or negative, with respect to a tweet term. Our hypothesis is that we can obtain high accuracy on classifying 
sentiment in Tweets using Deep learning techniques.

Data Sources: Based on an analysis of tweets since Mr. Trump declared his candidacy for president, on June 16, 2015. 
Retweets are not included. Some names may be omitted. This was first published in 2016; some of the people insulted have since died,
 and some people’s titles or public roles have changed. Dataset has been extracted from Kaggle to do text analysis.
